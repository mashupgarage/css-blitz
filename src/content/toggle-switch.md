## Tips and hints

- Only edit the `input`'s css selector.
- Use [`&` nesting pseudo selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Nesting_selector) like `&:checked` and `&:after`.
- [Guides] During darkmode, change the:
  1. Label's bg color and its `&:after`'s horizontal position
  2. SVG's colors
  3. div's bg color
