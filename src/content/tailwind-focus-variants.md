## Tips and hints

- Tip1: Use "focus-within" on the outer form container to highlight the entire card whenever any field inside it (such as the name, email, or password input) is active.
- Tip2: Tip: Use "focus" on each input field to give individual feedback for users. This will make it clear which specific field is active.
- Tip3: Tip: Use "focus-visible" on the "Sign Up" button to show focus styles only for keyboard users, without affecting mouse clicks.
